**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, I've always wanted to easily test animations in Fivem and I never really found the script that fits for what I want. So I decided to make my own and today I'm releasing it for free !

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-animations` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-animations` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, use the command /animations to toggle the menu.

**Features :sparkles: :**
* Accessible json file for all animations dict and names
* Search button to specify what you're looking for
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Up to date animations list
* Easy to use


*Demo :eyes:  :*

Feel free to open an Issue or make a PR to help me improve this resource !

*PS : I used this file to get the animations list so huge thanks to @DurtyFree : [gta-v-data-dumps](https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps)*
